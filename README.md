# PAYBACK Coding Challenge

"PayBackChallenge" is a SwiftUI app which contains all the required features. It should be noted that the team is currently transitioning to native solutions, so I have decided not to use any third-party libraries.

The main functionality of the app is managed by the "TransactionListViewModel". You can adjust the percentage of failing fetch data by modifying the "shouldFailResponse" variable in the "getTransaction()" method. Currently, it is set to 50%.

You can find the filtering functionality by clicking on the top-right button, which allows you to filter transactions by categories. Please note that I have given random names to the categories only for the purpose of the user interface.
